# awm

A place where you can have a conversation. Because you are not alone.

## Introduction

*Alone with Me* (awm for short) is a website that allows people to express their thoughts, concerns, beliefs, problems, or anything under the sun to someone. They simply type a message, hit send, and one of our volunteers will be reading their message. Sounds simple, right? It definitely is. The main point is that a lot of people would like to voice out their feelings and emotions. But they might feel insecure doing it out in the public, yet they still want to feel compassion with the fact that someone is indeed listening to them. AWM solves these concerns by providing individuals a place where they can share what they feel, with the complete anonymity of the sender and the recepient.

## Objectives

- To provide a safe place for people to share their thoughts with complete anonymity.
- To provide a simple interface for volunteers to read, assess, and reply to the messages.
- To provide admins an intuitive dashboard to monitor key metrics
